# Particle Systems Simulation

There is a need for simulations in many industrial and scientific fields. From animated movies and video games to aerodynamic vehicle simulations, there is great demand for realistic simulations. This project introduces simulations through developing a particle system with constraints, where the following have been implemented:
* Forces (Gravity, Spring and Angular Spring force)
* Constraints (Rod, Circular Wire, Line and Fixed constraint)
* Interaction with the particles
* Numerical integration schemes (Euler, Mid-Point, Runge-Kutta 4)
* 2D Cloth simulation
* Visualization of forces
