# Particle Systems Simulation

There is a need for simulations in many industrial and scientific fields. From animated movies and video games to aerodynamic vehicle simulations, there is great demand for realistic simulations. This project introduces simulations through developing a particle system with constraints, where the following have been implemented:
* Generalized force and constraint structures
* Interaction with the particles
* Numerical integration schemes
* 2D Cloth simulation
* Angular springs
* Visualation of forces
